# loan-approval-prediction-with-machine-learning-python
machine learning project using python
To make your README interactive and visually engaging, I can embed images of key graphs and visualizations generated from your notebook. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Generate Images**: Extract key plots and save them as PNG files.
2. **Embed Images in README**: Use markdown syntax to include these images.

Let‚Äôs start by extracting and saving the plots from your notebook. Then I'll create the final README.

I have generated placeholder visualizations for your project:

1. **Correlation Heatmap**: Shows relationships between features.
2. **ROC Curve**: Evaluates model performance.

Now, I'll embed these images into the README.

Here‚Äôs the updated README with the images embedded:
